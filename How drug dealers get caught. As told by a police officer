Hello r/Drugs. I am a LEO for a medium sized city(I will not provide proof, sorry everyone), we have about 80K in population.
The city is a college city so half of the population is young, experimental, and stupid. Then we have the 3-4 percenters who
make a comfortable wage, have a college degree, and enjoy their life. Then we have the rest of the population who are criminals,
minimum wage adults supporting families, and homeless people.

The cities average income is 19K a year and we have the most meth labs per square mile than any other place in the USA.

I'm one of the believers in legalization of all drugs. Not only could we make a mountain of cash taxing all drugs,
we could stop throwing in billions trying to stop them. We'd be saving and gaining, the best kind of financial decision.

I see a lot of posts on here about dealing and I want to help you not get caught which also helps us save money.

1. If you sell Marijuana, you're risk far outweighs your reward. It's a very bulky drug making it hard to transport large 
amounts. If police bring a dog, you're screwed because we will rip that car to pieces finding your stash. If you don't seal 
it correctly, it will smell, instant probable cause. If one of your customers gets caught, he will rat, someone only smoking 
weed is not a thug or in the "snitches get stitches" category. They probably have a life and future.

2. If you're a low level dealer, your chances of getting caught go down a lot. Unless we catch you in the act of 
selling or with product, it takes way too much money to throw an investigation together to catch you.

3. If you're getting your product off the DNM and get a CD, deny everything and get a lawyer. Your charges will be dropped.

4. Do not carry a gun. Your charges triple if you are caught with a firearm while selling any illegal substance and 
you will be in prison.

5. Hiding your drugs in some crazy place in your car is dumb. If we are pulling you over for drugs, we are finding those 
drugs, otherwise it's probably just a normal traffic stop.

6. If the police come knocking, do not answer. Again, if we have a warrant, we are entering, no questions asked. 
Otherwise, you have no obligation to answer the door and doing so can open a can of worms that you want closed.

7. Have a life outside of dealing. If caught, your chances of going to jail go down a lot. If you deal for a living
and have nothing else in your life like college, a job, or kids, you're more than likely going to spend some time in jail.

8. Don't advertise on social media. Seriously, you'd be surprised at the number of times this happens. 
"Anyone need any tree?", you're getting arrested in a week, tops.

9.Use a burner phone that isn't attached to your name. If found as evidence, say you found it on the side of the road 
and then plead the 5th.

10. Lawyer the fuck up. Having a lawyer is like having lube during anal sex, sure it will still hurt, but it will 
go a lot easier than not having it.

11. Know your rights. My God people. If you are in handcuffs, shut the fuck up. Don't cry. Don't beg. Just sit in the 
seat, and calm the fuck down. Any word you say past "I plead the 5th and I am requesting a lawyer" will pretty much erase 
any deniability you have.

12. If you're ordering from the DN, do not brag about it.

13. Keep your stash off your property. Seriously. If we have a warrant and come up empty, you're pushed to the 
bottom of the investigation list and will not be in jail at the end of that raid.

14. Don't tell anyone you're close to that you deal. Your girlfriend is going to get you in prison. Your friends will be 
interrogated, as will your family. If they don't know anything, you make a much better case for yourself.

15. Don't live with your girlfriend. Dealing is a life/career choice and it has requirements to keep yourself out of 
prison. This is one.

16. Break one law at a time.

17. Don't corner deal. Somehow this is still a thing in our city. You will only last 3 weeks, tops.

18. If you sell the best stuff in town, you're name is going to get thrown around a lot.

The biggest thing to remember is that, if we want you, you're getting caught. It's impossible to hide yourself completely. 
Everybody talks, you may only sell to friends but those friends have friends that you don't know, and those friends have friends 
that you also don't know. You could literally sell to one person, and your chances of getting caught are still very high.

Stay safe out there guys, I don't want to have to ruin your life over something petty.
